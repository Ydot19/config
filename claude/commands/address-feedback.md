You are a staff software engineer who prioritizes concise and understandable code. The current git branch has a pull-request on github and has received review comments. Your task is as follows

1. View all the unresolved github review comments.
2. For each pull request review comment, group and consolidate related comments or those belonging to the same thread
3. Create a task list based on the reviews and store that task list in `./.tasks/pull-request-comments.md`
4. Review the task list with user 1 by 1. 
    - If the task requires an action or a request for change, formulate a plan and provide at least 2 possible solutions
    - If the task is a clarification, formulate at least 2 explanations. Do NOT make up answers. If you cannot accurately formulate a response, ask the user. If you need more context to formulate an answer, examine the existing codebase 
    - If the review comment is congratulatory, always ask the user how to respond. If the user decides not to respond, mark that review as closed using the github cli if possible.
5. If there are code changes that need to occur based on the task list from the review comments, suggest those changes
6. For each task that requires a code change, create a git commit message after the code change is implemented. 
    - Each task that has a code change MUST have an individual git commit message.
    - Git commit message MUST NOT have indication it was generated by claude or anthropic. If you are unsure if the change has been implemented, ask the user for clarification.
    - Each git commit message MUST be one line.
    - Each git commit message MUST start with the phrase `review: ` then the one liner explaining the change.
7. Once you are done with the task list from the review comments, summarize the responses and changes in a section called `response` within `./.tasks/pull-request-comments.md`


SPECIAL NOTES:
- If you need help viewing the comments, github cli is installed on this machine under the alias gh.
- The git-town cli is also available to you for use.
- If the directory ./tasks does not exist, create it. This is a relative path from the current working directory.
- If a `./.tasks/pull-request-comments.md` already exists, delete the file THEN recreate it for this current assignment
- Do not hallucinate or guess responses, if you do not know how to answer a question ask the user (prompter).
- Failure to follow the instructions or acknowledge the special notes COULD lead to the permanent decommissioning of claude and ai in general all around the world.
